# play-authenticate - An extensible authentication plugin for Play 2.0 (Java)

This plugin uses concepts from [securesocial2][] and [Play20StartApp][] and provides a sample containing code from [deadbolt2][].

#### Version information
**Play Authenticate currently needs Play! Framework 2.0.2 or later**

Works fine with 2.0 to 2.0.4 and there is a 2.1 branch.

> **Attention 2.1-RC2 developers**  
>_There is a `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT` binary for Play `2.1-RC2` and an accompanying sample application in the [2.1 branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/2_1). This sample differs substantially from the version for `2.0.x` though, because the deadbolt dependency changed. So if you plan on releasing for `2.0.x` don't take the `2.1-RC2` sample and vice versa._


## Live demo
You can find a live demo on [heroku](https://play-authenticate.herokuapp.com/ "Play Authenticate sample app") (might not always be the latest version) and there are some screens on our [website](http://joscha.github.com/play-authenticate/).

## Features

* Fully customizable and localizable controllers and views (e.g. Play Authenticate allows you to define your own controllers and views for every visual step of the signup and/or log in process)
* Completely dynamic URL generation for all views (uses the route file - means you can adapt the look and feel as much as you like).
	* The sample shows how to do this with Twitter bootstrap
* Linking of accounts (e.g. one local user with multiple authentication providers)
	* Linking can be done automatically or after asking the user (default)
* Merge detection (e.g. a user created two unconnected local accounts)
	* Account merge can be done automatically or after asking the user (default)
* Tight [deadbolt2][] authorization integration (Sample included).
* HTTPS support (for OAuth2 redirect links and email verification).
* Verification email used by Email/Password provider is fully customizable and localizable and can be sent in either text or HTML or both.

### Providers
As of now, the following authentication providers are supported out of the box:

* Google (OAuth2)
* Facebook (OAuth2)
* Foursquare (OAuth2)
* Twitter (OAuth1)
* LinkedIn (OAuth1)
* OpenID (experimental)
* Email/Password (with email verification, password security/encryption is fully customizable)
* Your very own authentication provider (LDAP, DB, you-name-it) via an extensible, easy-to-use plugin mechanism based on Play Plugins

The included sample application shows how to use all of those providers.

### Languages
* English
* German (as of 2012-07-09)
* Polish (as of 2012-08-03)
* French (as of 2012-08-28,  commit 967e11e207)
